# Citi Bike Sharing
### Overview 
###### The purpose of this project is to gather information about a service through Citibikes in a large City. We are helping a woman named Katie present data to investors to bring Citi Bikes to Des Moines. 
### Results 
###### One of the first pieces of visual data is the length of time the bikes are checked out for all riders.

###### Using the graph you can see nearly 150,000 people use the bikes for at least 10 minutes. 
###### To further visualize the data we can break it down by gender of the user.

###### With this new graph it is clear that a majority of the bike users identify as male.

###### The heatmap above depicts the rides by hour during each day of the week. It appears the most utilizations are 8am, 5pm, and 6pm. 
###### During these peak times it appears that people that identify as male utilizate the Citi Bikes the most. This conclusion can be drawn from the detailed heat map below.

###### Citi Bikes also has an option for users to be annual subscribers to the service. The majority of the users which determined above, are male and they are also annual subscribers.

###### User data is very important however location is also important. While compiling the data we were able to make a graph were a majority of the rides were started.

###### Informaion that is also important is bike maintenance. It is obvious that bikes in areas that have high rates of usage are going to be repaired more.

###### The darker red in the above visualization represents the bikes that had the most rides. 
### Summary 
###### Utilizating the provided graphs it is very obvious the majority of users identify as Male. The peak times the bikes are used seem to be the start and end times of a normal work day (9am-5pm). I would conclude that the majority of users may use the bike sharing service to get to and from work. I would also create a visualizations that show what major landmarks are near by. Are there popular tourist areas within a certian radius? It would be ideal to promote the serivce as a convientent way to get from destination to destination to be able to see every popular destination. I would also want to create a visualization based on the age of users. We know a majority of the Citi Bike users are male but within what age group? A general assumption would be younger generations would be more likely to hear about the service virtually online through ads. If a majority of the users fall within a 18-35 year age group it would be ideal to invest in virtual advertisements.
